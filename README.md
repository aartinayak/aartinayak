Hello, I am Aarti. Thank you for taking some of your precious time out to check out my portfolio! Here is a little something about me, my beliefs and what I enjoy working on.

In my opinion, every piece of data holds a story waiting to be narrated, and I take pleasure in utilizing various databases and analytical tools to bring those stories to light. I am focused on interpreting data and using it to support organizations in optimizing their processes, refining their marketing strategies, and increasing their revenue.
